**About**</br>
The Chess is a board game for two players. This is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. 
It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. 
At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. 
The player who moves first controls white pieces, and the other controls black pieces. 
The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
